## Development

To run the project in development mode:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system
2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)

The development server features hot module replacement (HMR), so any changes you make to the code will be immediately reflected in the browser.
